Assignment
You are approaching again, swaying figures,
The early ones once showed themselves to the dull eye.
Am I trying to hold you this time?
Do I still feel my heart bent on that delusion?
You're pushing yourself in! Well, that's the way you may rule,
How you rise from haze and fog around me;
My breasts feel youthfully shaken
The whiff of magic that weathers around your train.
You bring with you the pictures of happy days,
And some dear shadows rise;
Like an old, half-faded legend
Bring up first love and friendship;
The pain becomes new, it repeats the lawsuit
The labyrinthine course of life,
And name the good guys who, for good hours
Deceived by luck, vanished from me.
You don't hear the following songs
The souls I sang the first to;
Destroying is the friendly crowd
Faded away, ah! the first contradiction.
My song sounds to the unknown crowd
Your applause itself scares my heart,
And what else is happy about my song
If it's still alive, it's scattered around the world.
And I am gripped by a longing that I have long since weaned
After that quiet, serious spirit realm
It is now floating in indefinite tones
My lisping song, like the Aol Harp
A shiver grips me, tear follows tears,
The strict heart, it feels mild and soft;
What I own, I see in the distance
And what disappeared becomes realities for me.

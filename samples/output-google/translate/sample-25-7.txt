You are approaching again, swaying figures,
Which early once showed itself to the gloomy gaze.
Am I trying to hold you tight this time?
Do I still feel my heart inclined to that delusion?
You're pushing yourself! well, you may rule
As you rise around me from haze and fog;
My bosom feels youthfully shaken
From the magic breath that surrounds your train.
You bring with you the images of happy days,
And some dear shadows rise;
Like an old, half-faded legend
First love and friendship come up with me;
The pain is renewed, the lament is repeated
Life's labyrinthine mad course,
And names the good ones, for good times
Deceived by luck, vanished from me.
You don't hear the following chants,
The souls I sang the first to;
The friendly crowd is gone,
Faded away, ah! the first echo.
My song sounds to the unknown crowd,
Your applause itself makes my heart tremble,
And what else delights in my song,
If it's still alive, it's scattered about the world.
And I'm gripped by a long-weaned longing
After that quiet, solemn realm of spirits,
It now floats in indefinite tones
My lisping song, like the Aeolian harp,
A shudder grips me, tears follow tears,
The stern heart feels mild and soft;
What I own I see in the distance
And what disappeared becomes real to me.
